Former musical theatre actress and recent Hackbright Academy graduate, Chloe is now a Developer Evangelist at Codefresh. Pre-Hackbright, she spent her nights and weekends performing in the Bay Area as a singer/actress and worked in tech by day. To support her theatre career, she started to learn to code on her own through online resources. She is now the first female engineering hire on her team- and is passionate about bringing people with non-traditional backgrounds into the world of tech.
