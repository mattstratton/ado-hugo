Ben Hughes is not a CTO, is not an award winning thought leader, nor an accomplished playwright. He is however a senior security engineer at Etsy. Before that he was breaking operations at Puppet Labs. He's also pretended to be a build engineer for cold hard cash, but he'd really rather not talk about it. He's spoken at conferences throughout the world on subjects such as security, devops, and security and devops.
