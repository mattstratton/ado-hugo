Dave is a software engineer who adopted a more peaceful role on the Product team at PagerDuty. Before PagerDuty, Dave worked in cloud computing at Microsoft (Windows Azure) and at Amazon.com launching their Grocery business. Frequently, he wonders which is scarier: being on-call during an outage or being a parent. The debate continues.
