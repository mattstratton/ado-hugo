Christian is an engineer at Nextpoint and an organizer of devopsdays Madison. Heâ€™s been an ops person for nearly 20 years, only getting out into the wider world of open source recently. He still misses ksh a little. Christian enjoys dancing, live music, board games, and suffers attending to the whims of Prickles the cat.
