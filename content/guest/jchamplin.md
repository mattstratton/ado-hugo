A 25-year-old hacker and thought laggard. Spends free time tinkering on computers, hanging out with friends, and riding motorcycles. Has no idea what the world balance means, and currently trying to get a life outside of devops. Friend of the mental health advocates. Insomniac, pursuer of the dark arts, and all around weirdo.
