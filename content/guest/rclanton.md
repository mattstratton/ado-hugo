DevOps enthusiast and Sr. Ops Leader with 16 years of IT experience at Target. My focus has been on introducing LEAN approaches to technology service delivery. I have led IT Ops, Engineering, IT Security, Enterprise Architecture, and Business Intelligence organizations. Through that time I’ve gained empathy for the challenges faced across different IT functions in large enterprises and perspective on the business and technology trends that are changing the industry, which has further fueled my passion for DevOps as a path forward. Beyond that, I’m a husband, father of two, Alaskan, MBA, owner of a Thai restaurant, business/technology advisor, enjoy DIY home construction, and not very good at sleep or work/life balance… My views expressed are my own…
