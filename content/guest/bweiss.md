As a red-and-blue-team member turned sysadmin herder, Bill had an early introduction to automation in security, and he's spent the rest of his career trying to bring that idea to more places. Along the way he found a passion for DevOps and organizing conferences which lead him to help with DevOpsDays Chicago two years and then Portland two more. He's currently at Rally Health leading their Security Operations group.
