Christine went to MIT, dropped out of an operating systems graduate program to be a kernel engineer at Ksplice, and has spent the last 5 years building Nylas, a startup building modern APIs for business communications. She's worn a lot of hats at the company, from developing software and running infrastructure to managing engineers and convincing folks to build with the platform. She currently serves as CTO.
