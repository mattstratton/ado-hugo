Todd Vernon, CEO & co-founder of VictorOps, started his engineering career at NASA before he realized he liked software more than hardware. Since then, Todd's been the co-founder / CTO of Raindance Communications, helping take the company public and lead its eventual acquisition by West Corporation in 2006. After that, he was co-founder / CEO of Lijit Networks (now sovrn), which has grown into one of the largest real-time ad exchange platforms on the internet.
